# üß¨ CA-SegPy: Cellular Automata-Based Image Segmentation in Python

**CA-SegPy** is an open-source Python implementation of the image segmentation algorithm proposed by Ascencio-Pi√±a et al. (Heliyon, 2024).
It reproduces and extends the method based on Cellular Automata (CA), providing a complete, modular, and reproducible implementation.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Reproduction of the three-phase CA segmentation process.
- Supports the BSDS300 dataset via KaggleHub.
- Includes evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM).
- Visualization utilities for comparing original vs segmented images.
- Designed for clarity, reproducibility, and easy extension.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monhelpierre/ca-segpy.git
cd ca-segpy
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or install directly via GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/monhelpierre/ca-segpy.git
```

## üß† Usage

### Example: Segment a single image

```python
from ca_segpy.runner import ca_image_segmentation
from ca_segpy.evaluation import evaluate_segmentation
import cv2

# Load grayscale image
img = cv2.imread("examples/paper_images/lena-paper.png", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Run segmentation
segmented = ca_image_segmentation(img, iter1=8, iter2=8, multiple=16)

# Evaluate segmentation
psnr, ssim = evaluate_segmentation(img, segmented)
print(f"PSNR: {psnr:.2f}, SSIM: {ssim:.4f}")
```

### Example Notebook

## üìä Results

Segmentation of BSDS300 sample images shows quality comparable to the original publication, measurable with PSNR/SSIM:

| Image  | PSNR | SSIM |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Lena   | 28.5 | 0.87 |
| Fruits | 27.9 | 0.84 |
| ...    | ...  | ...  |
